## Generations

The Kia Soul has gone through three main generations since its introduction:

- **First Generation (2009-2013)**: The first-generation Kia Soul was introduced as a compact crossover SUV with distinctive boxy styling. It offered a choice of 1.6L or 2.0L gasoline engines, with power outputs ranging from 122 hp to 142 hp depending on the market and configuration. The first generation established the Soul's unique design identity and urban-focused utility.

- **Second Generation (2014-2019)**: The second-generation Soul maintained the iconic boxy silhouette but featured more refined styling and improved build quality. Engine options included 1.6L and 2.0L gasoline engines with improved performance and efficiency. This generation also introduced the Soul EV, Kia's first mass-market electric vehicle for global markets, with a range of approximately 93 miles on a single charge.

- **Third Generation (2020-present)**: The current generation Soul builds on its predecessor's strengths with a more robust structure, enhanced technology features, and more sophisticated styling. The base engine is a 2.0L four-cylinder producing 147 hp, with an available turbocharged 1.6L engine generating 201 hp in the GT-Line trim. The Soul EV continues with significantly improved range, reaching up to 243 miles per charge in some markets, though availability varies by region.
