    description: "The first generation Kia Soul debuted at the 2008 Paris Motor Show and is manufactured in South Korea. Designed at Kia's design center in California, the Soul featured iconic boxy styling that defined its character. Powered by either a 1.6L or 2.0L four-cylinder engine, it offered adequate urban performance with manual or automatic transmission options. The interior featured quirky design elements and surprising space efficiency. Special editions like Denim, Ignition, Dragon, and Ghost helped establish the Soul's fun, youthful brand identity. For 2012, the Soul received upgraded powertrains including a new 6-speed manual and automatic transmission, along with the new 2.0-liter Nu engine replacing the old Beta engine. This generation earned a Red Dot design award in 2009 and established the Soul as a style-focused alternative to conventional compact cars."

The redesign features a wraparound greenhouse, high-mounted tail lights, large trapezoidal lower air intake, and a 'floating' body color panel on the liftgate. Built on a new platform shared with the Kia cee'd, 66% of the chassis utilizes Ultra High Strength Steel or High Strength Steel. Early models included a choice of 1.6-liter Gamma GDi or 2.0-liter Nu GDi engines, mated to 6-speed manual or automatic transmissions. The Soul EV debuted as an all-electric variant with approximately 93 miles of range, offering a 27 kWh lithium-ion polymer battery pack."

    description: "For model year 2017, the Soul underwent a facelift with minor body trim changes, new paint colors, and updated headlight options. The most significant change was at the top trim level, where the 2.0-liter Nu engine was replaced by a 1.6-liter turbo gasoline engine producing 201 HP and 195 lb-ft of torque, paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission. This powertrain change resulted in the car becoming one of the fastest in its class, with a 0-100 km/h time of approximately 7.8 seconds. The facelift maintained the distinctive boxy styling while refining details for a more modern appearance."

    description: "Kia unveiled the third generation Soul at the 2018 LA Auto Show. Unlike earlier models, it features thin headlights with a large grille remaining. Built on a new platform shared with the Hyundai Kona, it has a strengthened chassis for improved crash safety. Initial models in the US included two engine options: a turbocharged 1.6-liter engine producing 201 HP or a naturally aspirated 2.0-liter engine producing 147 HP, both with improved automatic transmissions. The Soul EV (e-Soul in some markets) returned with a 64-kWh battery pack offering significantly improved range. An X-Line trim became optional, providing a rugged appearance. This generation elevated the Soul's technology with available 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment, advanced safety features, and improved interior quality."

    end_year: 2025
    description: "For the 2023 model year, Kia updated the Soul with revised headlights, taillights, front bumper, and rear fascia, along with new two-tone color combinations and updated wheel designs. The rugged-looking X-Line trim was discontinued with this facelift. In the US market, the turbo version was discontinued, making the 2.0-liter Nu MPi naturally aspirated engine with CVT transmission the only available powertrain. The electric model (Soul EV/e-Soul) was discontinued in late 2023. Advanced driver assistance systems became more widely available, including forward collision avoidance, lane keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control. Despite updates, production of the Kia Soul ended in October 2025 due to declining sales and competition from newer models like the Seltos."
